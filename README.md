#  Hi, I'm Dansu John

**Software Engineer | STEM Facilitator | Network Enthusiast |Devops(still learning)** 

I build practical, scalable systems — from weighing automation apps (RS232 + Django) to modern web apps, dashboards, and backend services.  
I enjoy creating tools that simplify processes, improve efficiency, and deliver real value.
