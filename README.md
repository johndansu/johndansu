# Hi, I'm Dansu John

Software engineer who builds useful things:
- A weighing system (Django + RS232)
- A job-hunter that scrapes fresh listings
- DocFlow — generates PRDs, designs & user stories
- Nice frontend dashboards when needed
- “Whink” — my totally serious private repo (it's a joke) 😅

Currently learning DevOps… slowly, carefully, and with plenty of “why is this not working?” moments.

I like automation, clean backends, and simple UIs that look good.
